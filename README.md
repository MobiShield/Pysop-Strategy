# Pysop-Strategy

Pysopstrategy is an AI-powered Dip Shield bot designed to monitor token market conditions on pumpfun and coordinate full treasury reinjection strategies during 30% drawdown events.

The system continuously observes price data, detects structured drawdowns relative to recent peaks, and produces deterministic reinjection plans that allocate all accumulated developer fees and protocol profits back into the ecosystem when thresholds are met.

This repository focuses on detection, policy definition, accounting, and communication logic. Execution of capital movements is intentionally separated.

Overview
Pysopstrategy operates as a modular service composed of the following layers:

Market data ingestion
Drawdown detection
Treasury accounting
Reinjection planning
Automated communication and reporting
The system is designed to be transparent, auditable, and deterministic, with clear separation between policy logic and capital execution.

Core Principles
Threshold-based response
Reinjection events are triggered at 30% drawdowns from a rolling local peak.

Full allocation policy
All accumulated developer fees and protocol profits are allocated during each reinjection event.

Execution separation
This codebase does not perform swaps, trades, or on-chain execution directly.

Deterministic behavior
Identical inputs produce identical reinjection plans.
